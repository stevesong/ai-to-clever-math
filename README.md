  - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/millennials-to-snake-people/)
  - [Safari](https://github.com/a2/millennials-to-snake-people/releases)
- [Free your mind](https://www.google.com/search?q=Millennials)


## Also

- Uncomfortable that a non-compulsory, intentionally subversive browser extension uses language to affect your worldview, but still want a laugh? Try [Millennials to Snake People Pure](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/millennials-to-snake-peop/ekkcdmnckghgcbgkdfbafpgepbmkjhnd?hl=en-US)
- Addicted to text replacement plugins? Check out [Cloud to Butt Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cloud-to-butt-plus/apmlngnhgbnjpajelfkmabhkfapgnoai?hl=en), [SJW to Skeleton](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sjw-to-skeleton/kckodmjikeoncekpplppkkcjolofmacc?hl=en), [Millennials Begone!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/millennials-begone/dlgjecnejicmpdknhangcbeahbgipolf?hl=en)
